THIS PROJECT WAS MADE WHEN I WAS YOUNG AND NAIVE, THUS IT HAS VERY VERY POOR DOCUMENTATION. I DO NOT PLAN TO GO BACK AND DOCUMENT IT.

Refriend is a facebook app that anonymously places friends together for chats. It's like omegle.com, except the participants are always already friends with each other. The files found in this repo are used directly for Heroku hosting.

Live version can be found at http://refriend.herokuapp.com/

dependencies: socket.io
              node.js
